# Intoduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology and software development, understanding the perspectives, preferences, and challenges faced by developers is crucial for guiding industry trends, educational initiatives, and product development. A comprehensive survey was conducted by stackoverflow to gather data from developers worldwide and capture insights about their work environments, programming languages, tools, methodologies, and career aspirations.

# OBJECTIVE

The task at hand is to perform a detailed analysis of the collected survey data to extract meaningful and actionable insights and to practice my python skills learned on a structured data set including loading, inspecting, wrangling, exploring and drawing conclusion from data and have a deep understanding of the stackoverflow developer community .The notebook have the observation with each steps in order to explain throrougly how i approach the data set and based on observation some question are also answered.

**Data source & dataset**

**Name**: "StackOverflow developer survey dataset"

**year**: 2023

**description**: The dataset contains responses to an annual survey conducted by StackOverflow on how developer learn and level up, which tools they're using, and which ones they want.. The dataset contains over 64,000 responses to 83 questions, from different countries around the world(although many questions are optional).

# **Inferences and Conclusions**

We've drawn many inferences from the survey.

**Here's a summary of a few of them**:

Based on the survey respondents' demographics, we can infer that the survey is somewhat representative of the overall programming community. However, it has fewer responses from programmers in non-English-speaking countries. i.e the survey tends to have some selection bias.

Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Hence, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.

A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers, which can be a great way to break into the field, especially when you're just getting started.

Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2023, closely followed by python & SQL.

PostgreSQL & mySQL are the most used databases in 2023.

You can learn and start programming professionally at any age.

Full-stack, back-end, front-end, and desktop/enterprise app developers continue to account for the majority of all respondents(developertype).

Most programmers are individual contributors and are in the IT industry (49%), followed by financial services and supply chain.
